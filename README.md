> The preferred way to deploy this Bot is via Heroku. Using Heroku means that the bot doesn't run on your computer,
> is active 24/7 and you don't have to worry about the ffmpeg installation. Therefore this installation guide is
> going to describe how to do it.

> Heroku is a service which provides servers and much, much more. Depending on your needs, the server (a.k.a. Dyno)
> is free of charge the time writing this guide, it will cost you **nothing**.

### Install and deploy via Heroku
1. If you don't have a github account, create one and fork this repository - then clone it
2. If you don't have a Heroku account, create one and install Heroku CLI

### Before proceeding, you should create:
1. A new discord app (Bot)
2. A google developers account (to get a youtube API key to use for the bots playback service)
3. A openweathermap account (to use the bots weather service)

> Creating these accounts will cost you **nothing** aswell, by the time writing this guide.

  replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with the client ID copied
6. Join your server

#### Step 2 (Recommended)
To be able to use the music playback service you need to create a google developers account

```
heroku buildpacks: clear
heroku buildpacks: add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
heroku buildpacks: add https://github.com/issueapp/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg
```
5. Add the config variables prefixed with MY_VAR_ and UPPERCASED:
It's time to use the API keys that you **saved**:
```
heroku config:set MY_VAR_DISCORD=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN
heroku config:set MY_VAR_OPENWEATHERMAP=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY
heroku config:set MY_VAR_YOUTUBE=YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY
```
